								<p><br>
								Students can choose to work with their proposed theme of Project 2, or with a new subject of their choice. No matter which option they choose, students need to get the selected theme approved by their instructor.</p>
								<p>Additionally, students need to be aware of the complexity of the design process of a mobile application. As such, some questions need to be asked and answered by each student at the beginning of their design process to ensure that they are developing their app strategically.</p>
								<p><br></p>
								<p><strong>These questions include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
								<ul>
								<li>What is the exact issue I want to solve/improve upon?;</li>
								<li>What will be the specific focus of the mobile application?;</li>
								<li>Which of its users need will the mobile application fulfill, and how will it do so?;</li>
								</ul>
								<p><br></p>
								<p>For this project, students are invited to think beyond the screen and to consider what the mobile device itself offers to users and potential customers. </p>
								<p><br></p>
								<p><strong>Here are some examples of characteristics specific to mobile devices that need to be taken into consideration:</strong></p>
								<ul>
								<li>Notifications;</li>
								<li>Geo localization;</li>
								<li>Tracking data system;</li>
								<li>Communication aspect (text and voice components);</li>
								<li>Payment system.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><br></p>
								<p>Keep in mind that there needs to be a strong rationale behind the development of your mobile application. As such, if most of the identified issues/needs could potentially be solved/fulfilled by the creation of a typical website using a framework such as bootstrap, you need to articulate new questions/issues that require the creation of a mobile application.</p>
								<p>The choice of mobile device used should be based on the specific requirements of each student’s project. From a design perspective, students should look at all devices offered in InVision and choose the best one based on its characteristics.</p>
								<p><br></p>
								<p><br></p>
								<h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>
								<p>The process required for this project is similar to the one used for designing websites. However, since this project doesn&#39;t involve HTML or CSS coding, students are invited to get into more details at each step of the design process <em>(objective, user experience research, interaction design, user testing and visual design)</em>.</p>
								<p><br></p>
								<p><strong>Here is a list of questions and items to consider when designing your mobile application:</strong></p>
								<ul>
								<li>What does the user workflow look like? <em>(how do users login to the app? Do they need to create an account?)</em>;</li>
								<li>What are the vital functions for this standalone experience?;</li>
								<li>What kind of content is required to support these functions? <em>(Attention, smaller screen sizes require that extra attention is placed on text. Edit/cut down unnecessary content and display what is most important first)</em>;</li>
								<li>What technologies could assist users with their mobile experience? <em>(e.g. location aware services)</em>;</li>
								<li>Consider the context of use – distractions, multitasking, motion, lighting conditions and poor connectivity to name a few;</li>
								<li>You should also take into account the users’ mindset when using mobile devices: are they micro tasking <em>(using their mobile device for a short burst of activity)</em>, or are they bored <em>(using their mobile device for entertainment/passing time)</em>;</li>
								<li>What are the users frustration and pain points? Determine these through your persona development exercise. For example, do users need to sign in to the app every time they want to use it, or only when they want to make a transaction? Another example that might lead to users&#39; frustration is poor navigation and illogical positioning of links, options and irrelevant content;</li>
								<li>How will the navigation work? Reduce the number of categories and levels of navigation. Rearrange based on priority, always presenting the most important categories first;</li>
								<li>Make sure to use clear, concise and consistent labels for navigation across the app;</li>
								<li>Don&#39;t forget about the reality of touch screens: make sure the width and/or height of the different navigation items are at least 30 pixels <em>(as an example)</em> to ensure usability.</li>
								</ul>
